Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the "gui" and "vehicles" folders from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to <Your WoT Install Directory>\res_mods\<version> (EXAMPLE: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).
Optional:
- If you want to also apply the same Dunkelgelb color to the Panther/M10, drag the .wotmod file from inside the ADDON - Dunkelgelb M10 Panther folder to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\0.9.20.0). Thanks to Avalon304 for his original Grey Panther/M10 skin, and for giving me permission to use it as a base.
- Additionally, if you want to apply the same color to the Japanese HT No. VI or FCM36Pak40/leFH18B2, drag the .wotmod file from either the "ADDON - Dunkelgelb HT No. VI" or "ADDON - Dunkelgelb FCM36Pak40 & leFH18B2" folder (respectively) to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version> (same as above).

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only the tanks that are currently in HD have the color swap. The non-HD tanks still have their default grey color. Since WG is going to rework them into HD at some point anyways, I'd rather not have to re-do the mod twice for those tanks. Plus, the color shows up weird since they use the old model/texture system.

Enjoy!
