Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).
Optional:
- If you want to also apply the same Dunkelgelb color to the Panther/M10, drag the .wotmod file from inside the ADDON - Dunkelgelb M10 Panther folder to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\0.9.19.0.2). Thanks to Avalon304 for his original Grey Panther/M10 skin, and for giving me permission to use it as a base.
- Additionally, if you want to apply the same color to the Japanese HT No. VI, drag the .wotmod file from inside the ADDON - Dunkelgelb HT No. VI folder to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version> (same as above).

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only the tanks that are currently in HD have the color swap. The non-HD tanks still have their default grey color. Since WG is going to rework them into HD at some point anyways, I'd rather not have to re-do the mod twice for those tanks. Plus, the color shows up weird since they use the old model/texture system.

Enjoy!
